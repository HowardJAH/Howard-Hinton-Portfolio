# Howard Hintons MechE Portflio

In this portfolio, you will find further insight into some of the classes that better shaped my Mechanical Engineering career. Also included are porjects that have been meaningful to my engineering journey.  

# Senior Capstone (ME 170A/170B)

For my senior capstone, my team of four was tasked with designing a stoage system for Hydrogen Fuel cells that would be loaded onto large scale mining operation vehichles. Through this project I was able to work with a team and develop better understanding of team dynamics within an engineering space. I also developed greater CAD skills and better understanding of how to use those skills for analysis of materials and designs.
